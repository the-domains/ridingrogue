First entry on Valentine's Day.  It's a bit of a unique situation.  Both my wife and I (newly weds) started this space in order to detail our mindset on daily life: mortgage payment, work, task deadlines, etc... and then came to the conclusion that maybe going away from our monotonous lives, may open up a new perspective on happiness.  So, how do we do this you ask? By leaving our house in San Diego, California and cycling through Europe.  We don't have much of a plan, other than an one way plane ticket, but we will be venturing our way through Europe (hopefully other areas as well) and figuring what else is left to life other than the daily routine.  

Hence...

Riding Rogue started.
